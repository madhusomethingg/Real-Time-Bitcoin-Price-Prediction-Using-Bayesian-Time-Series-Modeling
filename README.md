# 📈 Real-Time Bitcoin Price Analysis Using Bayesian Modeling
### Uncertainty-Aware Forecasting in Volatile Financial Markets

> Real-time Bitcoin price analysis powered by PyMC3 and MCMC inference — combining live data ingestion, probabilistic time series modeling, and interactive dashboards to forecast prices with quantified uncertainty.

---

## 📌 Overview

Predicting cryptocurrency prices is hard. Predicting them *honestly* — with a clear sense of how uncertain those predictions are — is harder. Most forecasting systems give you a number. Bayesian models give you a distribution.

This project builds a real-time Bitcoin analysis pipeline that continuously fetches live price data, fits probabilistic models using PyMC3, and surfaces uncertainty-aware forecasts through interactive visualizations.

| Goal | Approach |
|---|---|
| How can we quantify uncertainty in volatile crypto markets? | Bayesian inference via PyMC3 + MCMC sampling |
| How do we model price dynamics in real time? | Live data ingestion + trend/seasonal decomposition |
| How do we make results interpretable? | Interactive dashboard with posterior predictive intervals |

## 🔬 Methodology

### 1. Data Collection & Preprocessing
- Fetches live Bitcoin prices via CoinGecko API (REST polling + WebSocket streaming)
- Cleans and validates raw data; structures it into time series using Pandas
- Stores processed data in a local database for historical lookups

### 2. Bayesian Modeling with PyMC3

The core of the project is a probabilistic model that treats price returns as draws from a distribution with unknown mean and volatility — both estimated from data using MCMC sampling.

```python
import pymc3 as pm

def create_price_model(data):
    with pm.Model() as model:
        σ = pm.HalfNormal('σ', sd=1)          # Prior for volatility
        μ = pm.Normal('μ', mu=0, sd=1)         # Prior for mean return
        returns = pm.Normal('returns', mu=μ, sd=σ, observed=data)
        trace = pm.sample(2000, tune=1000, return_inferencedata=False)
    return model, trace
```

Rather than producing a single price forecast, this yields a **posterior distribution** — a range of plausible outcomes with associated probabilities. That's the key advantage over point-estimate models.

### 3. Time Series Decomposition

Price data is decomposed into three components before modeling:

| Component | What It Captures |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Trend** | Long-term directional movement |
| **Seasonal** | Recurring patterns (daily/weekly cycles) |
| **Residual** | Noise and unexplained variation |

### 4. Model Diagnostics
- MCMC convergence checks (R-hat, effective sample size)
- Prior and posterior predictive checks
- Residual analysis and model comparison metrics

## 📊 Key Results

- Successfully ingests and processes live Bitcoin price data in real time
- PyMC3 posterior distributions provide calibrated uncertainty intervals around forecasts
- Time series decomposition isolates trend and seasonal components from noise
- Interactive dashboard displays real-time charts, Bayesian inference plots, and prediction intervals
- Automated price alert system triggers on threshold crossings

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Cryptocurrency markets are highly sensitive to external shocks (regulatory news, macro events) that no historical model can anticipate
- MCMC sampling is computationally expensive — real-time inference requires tuning sample sizes carefully
- The current model assumes stationarity in return distributions, which may not hold during high-volatility regimes

---

## 🔮 Future Work

- **Regime detection** — use Hidden Markov Models to identify bull/bear market states and switch model parameters accordingly
- **Hierarchical Bayesian models** — pool information across multiple cryptocurrencies to improve estimates in low-data regimes
- **Online learning** — update posterior distributions incrementally as new data arrives, rather than resampling from scratch
